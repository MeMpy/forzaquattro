Universisty project for the AI course.

Forza Quattro is the game globally called <b>Connect Four </b>

This is a Java version of the game with a focus on the cpu AI. We've used an alpha beta pruning as algorithm that evaluate the next best move. We also wrote the heuristic function that put out the value of the move. You can check it <a href="https://github.com/MeMpy/forzaquattro/blob/master/forzaquattro/src/connectFour/Heuristic.java"> here </a>. 

P.s: Sorry but the comments are in italian :(
